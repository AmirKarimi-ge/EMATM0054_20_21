    "# Supplementary Labsheet 0: Measuring Battery Voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "This suppplementary labshoot investigates measuring the battery voltage of your Romi whilst it is operating.  This labsheet is quite straight-forward and will introduce you to reading analog voltages.  Measuing the battery voltage of the Romi might be useful to:\n",
    "- detect and alert you to a critically low battery (which would alter the performance of your robot)\n",
    "- to adjust system parameters depending on your measured battery voltage.\n",
    "- to develop autonomous optimisations of Romi behaviour (e.g. optimised usage of battery whilst moving).\n",

    "- **VBAT**: is a pin connected to the batteries, which may be between 7.2volts or 9volts, depending on the type of AA-cell batteries installed.\n",
    "- **VSW**: is the battery voltage, after it has been through a power switching circuit (on/off) and a reverse-protection circuit (to attempt to prevent damage if the batteries are installed incorrectly).\n",
    "- That VSW can be monitored through the Arduino pin **A1**.  \n",
