    "## I'm using a float for a calculation but I always get a result of 0\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are performing a calculation and your result is always 0 or `NaN`, it is highly likely that you have an issue with the **type** of your variable.  Remember that an `integer` can only represent a whole number, whilst a `float` or a `double` can store fractional parts. Therefore, dividing two integers will often result in a rounding error.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When we are writing calculations for the Arduino it is important to understand a general rule: \n",
    "- **read the operation from right-to-left**, excepting the normal mathematical rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to assume the compiler (or Arduino) is very stupid, and will make the worst choice for you.  Therefore, you should try to make sure you are always using the appropriate variable type.  If you have a good (smart) compiler which handles types well, lucky you!  But why take that risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example within Arduino 1.8.13 will always report a result of 0, when (if done properly) it should report 0.5:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  float result;\n",
    "  int a;\n",
    "  int b;\n",
    "\n",
    "  a = 1;\n",
    "  b = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "  result = a / b;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Serial.println( result );\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, if we read left-to-right, it appears as if the following line is going to operate as a float:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  result = a / b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "...because we declared `result` as a `float`.  However, if we annotate our types and re-read the line from right-to-left:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  [float]result = [int]a / [int]b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "...we can see that `a/b` takes place as integers.  In this case, the compiler assumes the type on the right-hand side is (`int`), and executes the operation as `int` in working memory, and only afterwards stores the result into a `float`.  So your `result` will always store a 0 (rounding error).\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the above calculation a safer manner, the calculation can be broken into explicit steps, making use of <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Cast\">typecasting</a>, which also helps with the readability of your code:\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  float result;\n",
    "  int a;\n",
    "  int b;\n",
    "\n",
    "  a = 1;\n",
    "  b = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "  result = (float)a;\n",
    "  result = result / (float)b;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Serial.println( result );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see this phenomenon when working with hard-coded constants (\"magic numbers\").  The following code example will also produce a result of 0 on Arduino 1.8.13:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  float result;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  result = 1 / 2;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Serial.println( result );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, \"1\" and \"2\" have not been declared as variables, and therefore the compiler has to make a decision for you about what type they are.  Because they are written as whole numbers, the compiler decides they are `integers`, causing the same error as above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can work successfully with declared constants with the following minor adjustment, which prompts the compiler to treat the numbers as type `float`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "  float result;\n",
