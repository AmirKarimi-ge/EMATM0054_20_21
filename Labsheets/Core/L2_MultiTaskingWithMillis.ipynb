    "The problem with the above code is that when _delay( 10000 )_ is called, your program cannot do anything else - it will sit waiting for 10000 milliseconds.  Generally, this means your robot would not be able to respond to any new information.  This is referred to as **blocking** code.  \n",

    "Robots typically have to do many things at once, so it is no good if our program becomes blocked.  Instead, we want to write **non-blocking** code - code that can run when it is necessary, and otherwise let the microcontroller CPU do other tasks.  Blocking and non-blocking refer to the fact that code is **sequential**, the program runs (generally speaking) from top to bottom without any real intelligence for itself.\n",

    "The arduino _millis()_ function provides how many milliseconds have passed since the arduino was turned on (a timestamp).  The Arduino is configured by default to alway count up in milliseconds as a background task.  How this actually works is that the Timer peripheral _timer0_ is configured to keep track of time for you by using an _interrupt service routine (ISR)_.   It is useful to remember that _timer0_ is always counting up for you in the background from the moment the power is switched on.\n",

    "_millis()_ provides the number of milliseconds elapsed in the format **_unsigned long_** (more info <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/unsignedlong/\">here</a>).  This means the Arduino can count up to 4,294,967,295 milliseconds.  That is approximately 50 days.  After 50 days, it will reach the maximum value and begin counting from 0 again, which is called an **overflow**.  This means we can only use _millis()_ as a reliable mechanism for 50 days - it is not a perfect solution.  However, your Romi will probably run out of battery power before _millis()_ finished a complete count cycle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use _millis()_ to keep track of how much time has passed by recording the millisecond count from one time to another - we will refer to these as **timestamps**.  Note that _millis()_ is relative time - how much time has passed, **not the actual time of day**.  We therefore compare two values reported by _millis()_ to work out how much time has passed.  \n",

In labsheet 1 we used _analogWrite()_ to activate the buzzer.  _analogWrite()_ creates a voltage level by switching a digital pin on and off very fast - called pulse width modulation (PWM).  With analogWrite(), we effectively control the voltage level, but not the frequency (frequency is roughly how fast we are turning it on and off).  Therefore, your buzzer could only beep with one tone, but you were controlling the volume (the power).  \n",
